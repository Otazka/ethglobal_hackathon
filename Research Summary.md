## Telegram Mini Apps
Telegram Mini Apps (TMAs) are web applications that run directly inside the Telegram messenger. They are built using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and can offer a rich user experience. They provide a new way for businesses and developers to engage with audiences directly within Telegram's user-friendly interface. There are CLI tools like `@telegram-apps/create-mini-app` available to scaffold new mini applications.

## MetaMask Integration
MetaMask is a popular browser extension and mobile app that serves as a cryptocurrency wallet and a gateway to blockchain applications (dApps). Integrating MetaMask into a web application typically involves detecting the MetaMask provider in the user's browser, connecting to their accounts, and then using a Web3 library (like web3.js or ethers.js) to interact with the Ethereum blockchain through MetaMask. The MetaMask SDK simplifies integration across desktop and mobile.

## ETH and TON Transactions
**Ethereum (ETH) Transactions:** Ethereum transactions are cryptographically signed instructions that change the blockchain state. They involve sending Ether (ETH) or tokens (ERC-20, ERC-721, etc.) between addresses, interacting with smart contracts, or deploying new contracts. Block explorers like Etherscan provide detailed information about transactions, addresses, and network activity.

**TON (The Open Network) Transactions:** In TON, a transaction is a record of all changes that occurred to an account, handling incoming and outgoing messages, modifying state, and potentially generating fees. TON is designed for high transaction throughput. Tonscan is a block explorer for the TON blockchain, providing information on transactions, addresses, and network statistics.

## 1inch Fusion+ Integration
